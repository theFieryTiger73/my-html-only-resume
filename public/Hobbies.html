    <ul>
        <h3><li>Watching Movies</li></h3>
        <h4>What do I like about it?</h4>
        <p>A: <i>I'm someone who likes to appreciate a good film.<br> I find films very relaxing and informative - You can <br>learn a lot from a single movie than taking a whole<br>lecture</i></p>
        ---------------------------------

        <h3><li>Surfing  the Webb</li></h3>
        <p><i>I dont know why but it seems like i'm always trying <br> learn sth, I can say: "when sth is really good and<br> interesting to me, I like to lear about it - Specially <br>if it's sth about money"</i></p>
        ---------------------------------

        <h3><li>Sleeping</li></h3>
        <p><i>This should be in the top of the lis but it is grounded <br>for a while because even though it's good I always <br> wake up tired asf</i></p>
        ---------------------------------

        <h3><li>Walking Around</li></h3>
        <p><i>I can't say I love walking because it's tiring actually <br> but it's also the best way to get around and get to <br> know the city, and I love meeting new places, different <br> atmospheres, it relaxes me</i></p>
